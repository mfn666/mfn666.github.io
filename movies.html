<h1>Straight Outta Compton</h1>

<h3>Genre: Crime, History, Music
</br>

Data Release: 12 November 2015 (USA)</h3>


<p class="a">In 1987, five young men, using brutally honest rhymes and hardcore beats,
put their frustration and anger about life in the most dangerous place in America into the most 
powerful weapon they had: their music. Taking us back to where it all began, Straight Outta Compton
tells the true story of how these cultural rebels-armed only with their lyrics, swagger, bravado and
raw talent-stood up to the authorities that meant to keep them down and formed the world's most 
dangerous group, N.W.A. And as they spoke the truth that no one had before and exposed life in the
hood, their voice ignited a social revolution that is still reverberating today.

<h1>Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood</h1>
<h3>Genre: Crime,Comedy</br>

Date Release: 12 January 1996 (USA)

</h3>
<p class="a">"Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking your
Juice in the Hood" is a parody of several U.S. films about being in the 'Hood',
for instance "Boyz n the Hood", "South Central", "Menace II Society", "Higher Learning"
and "Juice". We follow Ashtray as he returns to the place he grew up in and meet his
father and his basket-case friends. Crazy stuff happens. For example, Ashtray is older
than his father and his best friend Loc Dog's grandmother is a trigger-happy old lady
who blames her eccentric-looking kid for not being tough enough.
